# Fortran4Researchers

These are the code files and example sheets for Warwick RSEs "Fortran for Researchers"
one-day workshop.

The Example codes referred to in the slides are in the ExampleCode directory, and the slides are in the Slides directory.


For the second part of the afternoon, we provide a series of suggestions for simple programs, from
the very basic through to some real codes. A pdf describing the suggestions is in the main directory.
We also provide "model solutions" for all of the suggestions. Note that these are just ONE way of
solving the problem, not necessarily the only one or the optimal one. Use them for suggestions how
to approach the problem, or as "oracles" showing the correct results.
